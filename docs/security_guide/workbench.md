# Deep Learning Workbench Security {#openvino_docs_security_guide_workbench}

Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) is a web application running within a Docker\* container.

## Run DL Workbench 

Unless necessary, limit the connections to the DL Workbench to `localhost` (127.0.0.1), so that it
is only accessible from the machine the Docker container is built on:

* The script [starting the DL Workbench from the
  package](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Install_from_Package) ensures that the container and the web
  application are accessible only from the `localhost` by default.

* When using `docker run` to [start the DL Workbench from Docker
  Hub](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Install_from_Docker_Hub), limit connections for the host IP 127.0.0.1.
  For example, limit the connections for the host IP to the port `5665` with the `-p
  127.0.0.1:5665:5665` command . Refer to [Container
  networking](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) for
  details.

## Authentication Security

DL Workbench uses [authentication tokens](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Authentication) to access the
application. The script starting the DL Workbench creates an authentication token each time the DL
Workbench starts. Anyone who has the authentication token can use the DL Workbench.

When you finish working with the DL Workbench, log out to prevent the use of the DL Workbench from
the same browser session without authentication.

To invalidate the authentication token completely, [restart the DL
Workbench](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Docker_Container).

## Use TLS to Protect Communications 

[Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)](@ref workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Configure_TLS) to keep the
authentication token encrypted.
