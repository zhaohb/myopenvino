## Media Files Available for Samples

To run the sample applications, you can use images and videos from the media files collection available at https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos.

## Samples that Support Pre-Trained Models

To run the sample, you can use [public](@ref omz_models_group_public) or [Intel's](@ref omz_models_group_intel) pre-trained models from the Open Model Zoo. The models can be downloaded using the [Model Downloader](@ref omz_tools_downloader).

## Build the Sample Applications

### <a name="build_samples_linux"></a>Build the Sample Applications on Linux*

The officially supported Linux* build environment is the following:

* Ubuntu* 18.04 LTS 64-bit or CentOS* 7.6 64-bit
* GCC* 7.5.0 (for Ubuntu* 18.04) or GCC* 4.8.5 (for CentOS* 7.6)
* CMake* version 3.10 or higher

> **NOTE**: For building samples from the open-source version of OpenVINO™ toolkit, see the [build instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/BuildingCode).

To build the C or C++ sample applications for Linux, go to the `<INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/c` or `<INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp` directory, respectively, and run the `build_samples.sh` script:
```sh
build_samples.sh
```

Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:
* C samples: `~/inference_engine_c_samples_build/intel64/Release`
* C++ samples: `~/inference_engine_cpp_samples_build/intel64/Release`

You can also build the sample applications manually:

> **NOTE**: If you have installed the product as a root user, switch to root mode before you continue: `sudo -i`

1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a samples build directory. This example uses a directory named `build`:
```sh
mkdir build
```
> **NOTE**: If you ran the Image Classification verification script during the installation, the C++ samples build directory was already created in your home directory: `~/inference_engine_samples_build/`

2. Go to the created directory:
```sh
cd build
```

3. Run CMake to generate the Make files for release or debug configuration. For example, for C++ samples:
  - For release configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp
  ```
  - For debug configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp
  ```
4. Run `make` to build the samples:
```sh
make
```

For the release configuration, the sample application binaries are in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Release/`;
for the debug configuration — in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Debug/`.

### <a name="build_samples_windows"></a>Build the Sample Applications on Microsoft Windows* OS

The recommended Windows* build environment is the following:
* Microsoft Windows* 10
* Microsoft Visual Studio* 2017, or 2019
* CMake* version 3.10 or higher

> **NOTE**: If you want to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, you are required to install CMake 3.14.

To build the C or C++ sample applications on Windows, go to the `<INSTALL_DIR>\inference_engine\samples\c` or `<INSTALL_DIR>\inference_engine\samples\cpp` directory, respectively, and run the `build_samples_msvc.bat` batch file:
```sh
build_samples_msvc.bat
```

By default, the script automatically detects the highest Microsoft Visual Studio version installed on the machine and uses it to create and build
a solution for a sample code. Optionally, you can also specify the preferred Microsoft Visual Studio version to be used by the script. Supported
versions are `VS2017` and `VS2019`. For example, to build the C++ samples using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, use the following command:
```sh
<INSTALL_DIR>\inference_engine\samples\cpp\build_samples_msvc.bat VS2017
```

Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:
* C samples: `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_c_samples_build\intel64\Release`
* C++ samples: `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_cpp_samples_build\intel64\Release`

You can also build a generated solution manually. For example, if you want to build C++ sample binaries in Debug configuration, run the appropriate version of the
Microsoft Visual Studio and open the generated solution file from the `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_cpp_samples_build\Samples.sln`
directory.

### <a name="build_samples_macos"></a>Build the Sample Applications on macOS*

The officially supported macOS* build environment is the following:

* macOS* 10.15 64-bit
* Clang* compiler from Xcode* 10.1 or higher
* CMake* version 3.13 or higher

> **NOTE**: For building samples from the open-source version of OpenVINO™ toolkit, see the [build instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/BuildingCode).

To build the C or C++ sample applications for macOS, go to the `<INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/c` or `<INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp` directory, respectively, and run the `build_samples.sh` script:
```sh
build_samples.sh
```

Once the build is completed, you can find sample binaries in the following folders:
* C samples: `~/inference_engine_c_samples_build/intel64/Release`
* C++ samples: `~/inference_engine_cpp_samples_build/intel64/Release`

You can also build the sample applications manually:

> **NOTE**: If you have installed the product as a root user, switch to root mode before you continue: `sudo -i`

> **NOTE**: Before proceeding, make sure you have OpenVINO™ environment set correctly. This can be done manually by
```sh
cd <INSTALL_DIR>/bin
source setupvars.sh
```

1. Navigate to a directory that you have write access to and create a samples build directory. This example uses a directory named `build`:
```sh
mkdir build
```
> **NOTE**: If you ran the Image Classification verification script during the installation, the C++ samples build directory was already created in your home directory: `~/inference_engine_samples_build/`

2. Go to the created directory:
```sh
cd build
```

3. Run CMake to generate the Make files for release or debug configuration. For example, for C++ samples:
  - For release configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp
  ```
  - For debug configuration:
  ```sh
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <INSTALL_DIR>/inference_engine/samples/cpp
  ```
4. Run `make` to build the samples:
```sh
make
```

For the release configuration, the sample application binaries are in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Release/`;
for the debug configuration — in `<path_to_build_directory>/intel64/Debug/`.

## Get Ready for Running the Sample Applications

### Get Ready for Running the Sample Applications on Linux*

Before running compiled binary files, make sure your application can find the
Inference Engine and OpenCV libraries.
Run the `setupvars` script to set all necessary environment variables:
```sh
source <INSTALL_DIR>/bin/setupvars.sh
```

**(Optional)**: The OpenVINO environment variables are removed when you close the
shell. As an option, you can permanently set the environment variables as follows:

1. Open the `.bashrc` file in `<user_home_directory>`:
```sh
vi <user_home_directory>/.bashrc
```

2. Add this line to the end of the file:
```sh
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
```

3. Save and close the file: press the **Esc** key, type `:wq` and press the **Enter** key.
4. To test your change, open a new terminal. You will see `[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO environment initialized`.

You are ready to run sample applications. To learn about how to run a particular
sample, read the sample documentation by clicking the sample name in the samples
list above.

### Get Ready for Running the Sample Applications on Windows*

Before running compiled binary files, make sure your application can find the
Inference Engine and OpenCV libraries.
Use the `setupvars` script, which sets all necessary environment variables:
```sh
<INSTALL_DIR>\bin\setupvars.bat
```

To debug or run the samples on Windows in Microsoft Visual Studio, make sure you
have properly configured **Debugging** environment settings for the **Debug**
and **Release** configurations. Set correct paths to the OpenCV libraries, and
debug and release versions of the Inference Engine libraries.
For example, for the **Debug** configuration, go to the project's
**Configuration Properties** to the **Debugging** category and set the `PATH`
variable in the **Environment** field to the following:

```sh
PATH=<INSTALL_DIR>\deployment_tools\inference_engine\bin\intel64\Debug;<INSTALL_DIR>\opencv\bin;%PATH%
```
where `<INSTALL_DIR>` is the directory in which the OpenVINO toolkit is installed.

You are ready to run sample applications. To learn about how to run a particular
sample, read the sample documentation by clicking the sample name in the samples
list above.
