## Introduction to the OpenVINO™ Toolkit

The OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit that you can use to develop and deploy vision-oriented solutions on
Intel® platforms. Vision-oriented means the solutions use images or videos to perform specific tasks.
A few of the solutions use cases include autonomous navigation, digital surveillance cameras, robotics,
and mixed-reality headsets.

The OpenVINO™ toolkit:

* Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge
* Supports heterogeneous execution across an Intel&reg; CPU, Intel&reg; Integrated Graphics, Intel&reg; Neural Compute Stick 2
* Speeds time-to-market via an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels
* Includes optimized calls for computer vision standards including OpenCV\*, OpenCL&trade;, and OpenVX\*

The OpenVINO™ toolkit includes the following components:

* Intel® Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit (Intel® DLDT)
    - [Deep Learning Model Optimizer](../MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md) — A cross-platform command-line tool for importing models and
    preparing them for optimal execution with the Deep Learning Inference Engine. The Model Optimizer supports converting Caffe*,
    TensorFlow*, MXNet*, Kaldi*, ONNX* models.
    - [Deep Learning Inference Engine](inference_engine_intro.md) — A unified API to allow high performance inference on many hardware types
    including Intel® CPU, Intel® Processor Graphics, Intel® FPGA, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2.
    - [nGraph](../nGraph_DG/nGraph_dg.md) — graph representation and manipulation engine which is used to represent a model inside Inference Engine and allows the run-time model construction without using Model Optimizer.
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/) — OpenCV* community version compiled for Intel® hardware.
Includes PVL libraries for computer vision.
* Drivers and runtimes for OpenCL™ version 2.1
* [Intel® Media SDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/media-sdk)
* [OpenVX*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/cvsdk-ovx-guide) — Intel's implementation of OpenVX*
optimized for running on Intel® hardware (CPU, GPU, IPU).
* [Demos and samples](Samples_Overview.md).


This Guide provides overview of the Inference Engine describing the typical workflow for performing
inference of a pre-trained and optimized deep learning model and a set of sample applications.

> **NOTES:**
> - Before you perform inference with the Inference Engine, your models should be converted to the Inference Engine format using the Model Optimizer or built directly in run-time using nGraph API. To learn about how to use Model Optimizer, refer to the [Model Optimizer Developer Guide](../MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md). To learn about the pre-trained and optimized models delivered with the OpenVINO™ toolkit, refer to [Pre-Trained Models](@ref omz_models_group_intel).
> - [Intel® System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/system-studio) is an all-in-one, cross-platform tool suite, purpose-built to simplify system bring-up and improve system and IoT device application performance on Intel® platforms. If you are using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ with Intel® System Studio, go to [Get Started with Intel® System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/get-started-with-openvino-and-intel-system-studio-2019).
