Intel will be transitioning to the next-generation programmable deep-learning solution based on FPGAs in order to increase the level of customization possible in FPGA deep-learning. As part of this transition, future standard releases (i.e., non-LTS releases) of Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit will no longer include the Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with an Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA and the Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel® Arria® 10 GX FPGA.

Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2020.3.X LTS release will continue to support Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with an Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA and the Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel® Arria® 10 GX FPGA. For questions about next-generation programmable deep-learning solutions based on FPGAs, please talk to your sales representative or contact us to get the latest FPGA updates.

For documentation for previous releases of Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux* with FPGA Support, see documentation for the [2020.4 version](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.4/openvino_docs_install_guides_PAC_Configure.html) and lower.
