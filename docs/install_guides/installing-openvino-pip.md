# Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit from PyPI Repository {#openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_pip}

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit provides the following packages available for installation through the PyPI repository:

* Runtime package with the Inference Engine inside: [https://pypi.org/project/openvino/](https://pypi.org/project/openvino/).
* Developers package that includes the runtime package as a dependency, Model Optimizer, Accuracy Checker and Post-Training Optimization Tool: [https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev).
